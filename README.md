# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It's a discipline of systematic application of engineering principles, development and maintenace of software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering is a discipline of systematic application of engineering principles, development and maintenace of software systems while traditional programming is the process of writing a code using a programming language
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
These are the stages that a code goes through in order to become a program of a software.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is the repetetive approach focused mainly on flexibility collaboration and responding to change while waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases worked on individually from one stage to the other.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile focuses on flexibility collaboration and responding to change while waterfall enacts the systematic approach from one stage to the other.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
modularity is the extent in which a piece of code may be broken down into smaller modules that can be worked on separately. This is able to be achieved through ensuring that each module has got its own functionality and interacts with other modules to ensure sacalability and maintainability is achieved. 
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing- individual components of a code in isolation to ensure they function correctly
integration testing- checks the data flow from one module to the other
system testing- evaluates both functional and non-functional needs for the testing
acceptance testing- checks whether the requirements of a specification are met as per its delivery
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
These are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members
1.they keep tack of changes to the code
2.help develop products faster
they include; Git, Mercurial, Subversion.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
1.providing consistent  leadership to the team members
2.planning out te blueprints for software projects
3.assembling and leading a project team
 1.change of clients needs and interests
 2.team conflicts due to lack of a shared vision
 3.tight deadlines
 4.technical debt
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
it's the process of modifying and updating a software system and it ensures that the software continues to meet the needs of the users
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1.algorithm bias
2.unethical data collection
3.weak security
4.wrong priorities
1.ensuring that the programmers set their priorities right
2.ensuring that the ways used for data collection are credible
3.providing strong security measures to the code and systems
ensuring that there is no algorithm bias among programmers
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
